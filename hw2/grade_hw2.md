### Overall Grade: 120/125

### Quality of report: 10/10

-   Is the homework submitted (git tag time) before deadline? 

    Yes
  
-   Is the final report in a human readable format html? 

    Yes
  
-   Is the report prepared as a dynamic document (Jupyter Notebook) for reproducibility?

    Yes
  
-   Is the report clear (whole sentences, typos, grammar)? Do readers have a clear idea what's going on and how are results produced by just reading the report? 

    Yes
  
### Completeness, correctness and efficiency of solution: 72/75

- Q1.3 (NNMF correctness) (10/10)

- Q1.3 (NNMF efficiency) (20/20)

- Q1.4 (non-uniqueness) (4/5)

    Dr. Zhou wanted some mention of non-convexity or potential local minima.

- Q1.5 (Fixed point) (4/5)

    Should mention how many iterations it took to converge (very few)

- Q1.6 (Interpretation of NNMF) (4/5)

    Shading? We want you to say it shows different components of the face. Read the Nature paper.
    
- Q1.7 (GPU, optional) (20 bonus points) (0/20)

- Q2.2 (Kinship correctness) (10/10)

- Q2.3 (Kinship efficiency) (20/20)

### Usage of Git: 8/10

- Are branches (`master` and `develop`) correctly set up? Is the hw submission put into the `master` branch?

    Yes
  
- Are there enough commits? Are commit messages clear? 
          
    No. Only 3 commits to HW2, all in one day, and only 2 appear to be related to the HW. This is not good practice. `-2`.
  
- Is the hw submission tagged? 

    Yes
  
- Are the folders (`hw1`, `hw2`, ...) created correctly? 
  
    Yes
  
- Do not put a lot auxiliary files into version control. 


### Reproducibility: 10/10

- Are the materials (files and instructions) submitted to the `master` branch sufficient for reproducing all the results? 

    Yes
  
- If necessary, are there clear instructions, either in report or in a separate file, how to reproduce the results?

### Julia code style: 20/20

- Rule (4). Four space indenting rule. 

- Rule (6). 80 charcter rule.

- Rule (7). Space after comma rule.

- Rule (8). No space before comma rule.

- Rule (9). Space around operator rule.
